# A-Study-on-Bias-Input-and-Algorithmic-in-ML-Systems
I explore different deep learning architecture for multi-class and multi-label classification and see how different architecture is classifying same text with slightly different labels and effect of input word vectors on models.




This folder consists of the original dataset, report, and the completed codes for the toxic comment classification and a study of bias.

 1.For Data exploration and analysis code please refer to: EDA.ipynb
 2.For Data cleaning code please refer to:  Data Cleaning.ipynb
 3.For Baseline model code please refer to: Logistic Regression.ipynb
 4.For Deep Learning models, stacking model and Explainable AI(LIME): DL_Models_and_Analysis.ipynb

Note: Please download the data to the same folder as the code to successfully run the code.
